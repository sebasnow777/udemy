# udemy
Udemy related course material and excercises. Mostly for purpose of transfer of projects between devices.

Purpose of this repository is to upload udemy course projects to github to track and show progress.

Also to transfer files between my 2 current machines Linux Laptop and Macbook air so I can continue
on the same project if I am staying home.
